This project will focus on creating a basic neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset

The MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset is one of the most famous datasets in machine learning, primarily used for image classification tasks. It consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) and is widely used as a benchmark for testing and learning machine learning algorithms, especially in computer vision.

Key Features of MNIST:
Size of Dataset:
Training set: 60,000 images.
Test set: 10,000 images.
Image Characteristics:
Each image is 28 pixels by 28 pixels.

Grayscale images with pixel values ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white). In most implementations, the pixel values are normalized to a range of 0 to 1 or -1 to 1.

Labels:
Each image is labeled with the digit it represents, ranging from 0 to 9.

Applications:
Testing classification algorithms.
Understanding the basics of neural networks, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Benchmarking and prototyping.
